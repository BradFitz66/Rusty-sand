# Rusty-sand

Learning rust. Similar to beef-sand when I was learning beef, I've decided to make a falling sand game.


Using ~~bevy, with the bevy_pixel (a port of the rust pixels library to work with bevy)~~ ~~Piston, with the Image image processing library~~ SDL2 with the normal pixels library.

Code will probably be awful. I'm still learning.
